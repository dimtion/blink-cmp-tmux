# blink-cmp-tmux

Port of the [andersevenrud/cmp-tmux](https://github.com/andersevenrud/cmp-tmux)
completion source for the [blink.cmp] [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
plugin.

## Features

- Integrates with [tmux] to provide completion suggestions based on the content
  of [tmux] panes.
- Supports capturing content from all panes or only the current pane.
- Allows capturing the history of panes for more comprehensive suggestions.
- Configurable trigger characters to activate completions.

## Requirements

- [tmux]
- [blink.cmp]

## Installation & Configuration

            session_panes = false,
            capture_history = false,
            -- only suggest completions from `tmux` if the `trigger_chars` are
            -- used
